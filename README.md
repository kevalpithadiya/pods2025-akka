### Akka (Java) Marketplace Backend

This is a course project by Keval and Debanjan for the course "Principles of Distributed Software (2025)".
<br>
This Project includes:
  - Previous user and wallet services from springboot.
  - We redeveloped the marketplace using Akka cluster sharding.
  - We tested the code for handling concurrent requests.
  - Each service can be implemented as separate containers and connect using http.
